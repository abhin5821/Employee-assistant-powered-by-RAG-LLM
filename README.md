## Enterprise-Ready Conversational AI: A RAG-Powered Chatbot for Internal Knowledge Management

Developed a secure, on-premise conversational AI assistant to enable employees to query internal documentation through a natural language interface. This project leverages a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline used to load relevent documents from the vector database chromadb based on query and context, orchestrated with LangChain, to ground a locally-hosted Llama 3 8B Instruct model in a private knowledge base. The system features a decoupled three-tier architecture with a FastAPI backend for AI logic and a dynamic Streamlit frontend for user interaction, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
